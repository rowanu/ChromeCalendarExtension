# Chrome Calendar

A better Chrome Extension for managing your Google Calendar.

## Goal

To never have to visit the default [Google
Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) again!

## Features

__Quick Add from toolbar/omnibox__: Just type `cc` and your event's details (in
plain text) eg. `cc openbar at 8pm tonight`. You will get confirmation when you
event is added. The confirmation will automatically disappear after 5 seconds.

__View today's events__: The Chrome Calendar icon (next to the toolbar) shows
you how many events you have left today. Clicking on the icon shows you a list
of your remaining events today, and when they are (automatically refreshed every
5 minutes).

### Planned

__Automatic detection of dates in the page__: Just click on the highlighted text
to see what events you have on that date, or to add it as a new event to your
calendar.

__Right-click menu__: See your upcoming events through a quick list, accessed
through the right-click menu.
