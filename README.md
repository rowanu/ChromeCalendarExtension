# Chrome Calendar

A better Chrome Extension for managing your Google Calendar.

Created at [HackMTL 2013](http://montrealtechwatch.com/2013/08/19/hackmtl-140-developers-36-projects-24-hours-hackathon-at-the-olympic-stadium/).

## Goal

To never have to visit the default [Google
Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) again!

## Features

__Quick Add from toolbar/omnibox__: Just type `cc` first, followed by your event's details (in
plain text) eg. `cc<space>open bar at 8pm`. You will get confirmation when you
event is added. The confirmation will automatically disappear after 5 seconds.

__View today's events__: The Chrome Calendar icon (next to the toolbar) shows
you how many events you have left today. Clicking on the icon shows you a list
of your remaining events today, and when they are (automatically refreshed every
5 minutes).

__Add dates from selected text__: Simply select the text for your event and
right-click to quickly add an event to your calendar.

__Right-click to see today's events__: See today's events through a quick list,
accessed through the right-click menu.

### Coming Soon!

__Automatic detection of dates in the page__: Just click on the highlighted text
to see what events you have on that date, or to add it as a new event to your
calendar.

__Right-click to see all events__: See your upcoming events through a quick list, accessed
through the right-click menu.

__Keyboard shortcuts from anywhere!__: Probably Vim-based, because Vim is the best.

## Tweaks

[ ] Give add event notice (partially) edit link (open in new tab)
